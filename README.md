# LaundryView
LaundryView iOS 8 App for Wake Forest University.

An iOS app that tracks the laundry machines in the dorms at Wake Forest
University. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wfu-laundryview/id431321503?mt=8 

The application provides the users with the status of their laundry in
real-time. It sends them a push notification when their laundry is complete. I
created all the user interface elements and built the application in
Objective-C. The project took 3 weeks to complete. The application retrieves the
data of the laundry machines from an API and the data is fed into the
application.
