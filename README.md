# LaundryView
LaundryView iOS 10 App for Embry Riddle Aeronautical University.

Modified from https://github.com/laddng/LaundryView to work with Embry Riddle's laundryview

The application provides the users with the status of their laundry in
real-time. It sends them a push notification when their laundry is complete. I
created all the user interface elements and built the application in
Objective-C. The application retrieves the data of the laundry machines from 
an API and the data is fed into the application.
